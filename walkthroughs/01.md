# Walkthrough - Creating User Stories

[Back to Challenge](../01_creating_user_stories.md)

The precise details of the user story is up to you. Here's my go:

```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of bookmarks
```

Here's what I came up with as a domain model:

![Bookmark Manager domain model](../images/bookmark_manager_1.png)

- When the user visits the '/bookmarks' path, their browser sends a request to a controller we built.
- When the controller gets the request, it asks the `Bookmark` class to give it all the bookmarks, i.e. the controller asks for `Bookmark.all`.
- The `Bookmark` class goes and gets the bookmarks, and gives back all the bookmarks in an array to the controller.
- The controller renders the array of bookmarks to a webpage, which it sends as a response to the user

So, it feels like the first things we need are:
 - a Controller
 - a Bookmark class
 - A bookmark view

> That's enough design for now. We should aim to start coding sooner rather than later.
