# Walkthrough – REST and Resources

[Back to the Challenge](../16_one_to_many_relationships.md)

In a one-to-many relationship, there are two models:

- one 'parent' model, `Bookmark`, _has many_ `Comment`s.
- the 'child' model, `Comment`, _belongs to_ a single `Bookmark`.

```
  ONE       ––≡≡   MANY
 Bookmark   ––≡≡  Comments
```

The only way to store this in a table relationship is to add an extra column to the 'child' model.

For instance, in the table below, the first two comments refer to a Bookmark with an ID of 1. The last comment refers to a Bookmark with an ID of 2:

```
| id | text                       | bookmark_id |
|----|----------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | Great Bookmark!            | 1           |
| 2  | I don't like this Bookmark | 1           |
| 3  | What a cool resource       | 2           |
```

Comments with ID 1 and 2 are comments on the same Bookmark. If they were displayed, they'd look like this:

- Bookmark 1
  - Great Bookmark!
  - I don't like this Bookmark.
- Bookmark 2
  - What a cool resource

## 1. Viewing Comments

Before we start writing tests, let's add a new table to the development and test databases for storing comments, using the `psql` command
```
CREATE TABLE comments(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, text VARCHAR(240), bookmark_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookmarks (id));
```
When you run tests after setting up this table you will see an error - you'll need to make a simple fix to your `test_database_setup` helper to `TRUNCATE` the comments table as well as bookmarks.

Let's save this step in the `migrations` directory:

```bash
# in db/migrations/03_create_comments_table.sql

CREATE TABLE comments(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, text VARCHAR(240), bookmark_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookmarks (id));

```

So you can keep track of how to setup the Bookmark Manager database.

### Feature test

Now the database is setup to store comments, let's write a feature test for viewing a comment on a bookmark:

```ruby
# in spec/features/adding_and_viewing_comments_spec.rb

feature 'Adding and viewing comments' do
  feature 'a user can add and then view a comment' do
    scenario 'a comment is added to a bookmark' do
      bookmark = Bookmark.create(url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com', title: 'Makers Academy')

      visit '/bookmarks'
      first('.bookmark').click_button 'Add Comment'

      expect(current_path).to eq "/bookmarks/#{bookmark.id}/comments/new"

      fill_in 'comment', with: 'This is a second comment'
      click_button 'Submit'

      expect(current_path).to eq '/bookmarks'
      expect(first('.bookmark')).to have_content 'this is a test comment on this bookmark'
    end
  end
end
```

### Adding a form for new comments

Following the path of error messages leads us to first update the `/bookmarks` view:

```html
<ul>
  <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
    <li id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
      <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
        <%= bookmark.title %>
      </a>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>" method="post">
        <input type='hidden' name='_method' value='DELETE'/>
        <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
      </form>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>/edit" method="get">
        <input type="submit" value="Edit" />
      </form>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>/comments/new" method="get">
        <input type="submit" value="Add Comment" />
      </form>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Then set up the route in `app.rb`:
```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/bookmarks/:id/comments/new' do
  @bookmark_id = params[:id]
  erb :'comments/new'
end
```

And create the view for the comment form:
```html
<!-- in views/comments/new.erb -->

<form action="/bookmarks/<%= @bookmark_id %>/comments" method="POST">
  <input name="comment" type="text" />
  <input value="Submit" type="submit" />
</form>
```

Then update the controller to handle the comment creation:
```ruby
# in app.rb

class BookmarkManager < Sinatra::Base
  # code omitted for brevity

  post '/bookmarks/:id/comments' do
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
    connection.exec("INSERT INTO comments (text, bookmark_id) VALUES('#{params[:comment]}', '#{params[:id]}');")
    redirect '/bookmarks'
  end
end
```

### Update the view

Now we're ready to update the view to render comments:

```html
<% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
  <li id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
    <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
      <%= bookmark.title %>
    </a>
    <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>" method="post">
      <input type='hidden' name='_method' value='DELETE'/>
      <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
    </form>
    <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>/edit" method="get">
      <input type="submit" value="Edit" />
    </form>
    <ul>
      <% bookmark.comments.each do |comment| %>
        <li><%= comment['text'] %></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
  </li>
<% end %>
```

This change to the view breaks quite a few of the tests. Why might this be? Try running the application and viewing the bookmarks to see what error Sinatra provides.

We need to update the `Bookmark` instance to respond to the `comments` method, and return an array of `comments`.

### Update the Model

Let's start with a test:

```ruby
# in spec/bookmark_spec.rb

describe '#comments' do
  it 'returns a list of comments on the bookmark' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(title: 'Makers Academy', url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
    DatabaseConnection.query("INSERT INTO comments (id, text, bookmark_id) VALUES(1, 'Test comment', #{bookmark.id})")

    comment = bookmark.comments.first

    expect(comment['text']).to eq 'Test comment'
  end
end
```

And then the code that gets this test passing:

```ruby
# in lib/bookmark

class Bookmark
  # code omitted for brevity

  def comments
    DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM comments WHERE bookmark_id = #{id};")
  end
end
```

The feature test is now passing.

## 3. Refactor

Now we can both view and add comments, it's a great time to refactor. When we modelled this section we identified that `Comments` are a different type of thing to `Bookmarks`, so let's create a Model to handle comment creation.

Start by updating `app.rb`:

```ruby
require_relative './lib/comment'

class BookmarkManager < Sinatra::Base
  # code omitted for brevity

  post '/bookmarks/:id/comments' do
    Comment.create(text: params[:comment], bookmark_id: params[:id])
    redirect '/bookmarks'
  end
end
```

Here I'm imagining a similar interaction to creating a Bookmark. The feature test is now failing again, so let's TDD the implementation of `Comment`:

First, we need to make a change to the `persisted_data` helper so that it can query different tables:

```ruby

# in spec/database_helpers.rb
require '../lib/database_connection'

def persisted_data(table:, id:)
  DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM #{table} WHERE id = '#{id}';")
end
```

If you run the tests now you'll see that the Bookmark tests have started failing. To get them passing again, update the tests that use the `persisted_data` helper to pass in the table name `bookmarks`.

Now we can write the test for creating a new `Comment`:

```ruby
# in spec/comment_spec.rb

require 'persisted_data'

require 'comment'
require 'bookmark'

describe Comment do
  describe '.create' do
    it 'creates a new comment' do
      bookmark = Bookmark.create(url: "http://www.makersacademy.com", title: "Makers Academy")
      comment = Comment.create(text: 'This is a test comment', bookmark_id: bookmark.id)

      persisted_data = persisted_data(table: 'comments', id: comment.id )

      expect(comment).to be_a Comment
      expect(comment.id).to eq persisted_data.first['id']
      expect(comment.text).to eq 'This is a test comment'
      expect(comment.bookmark_id).to eq bookmark.id
    end
  end
end
```

>You might notice that there is a hard dependency here on setting up a `Bookmark` in the `Comment` test. When this test is passing as is, try removing the `Bookmark` creation from the test and running it again. What is happening now?

Let's write the code to pass the test:
```ruby
class Comment
  def self.create(bookmark_id:, text:)
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("INSERT INTO comments (bookmark_id, text) VALUES ('#{bookmark_id}','#{text}') RETURNING id, text, bookmark_id;")
    Comment.new(
      id: result[0]['id'],
      text: result[0]['text'],
      bookmark_id: result[0]['bookmark_id']
    )
  end

  attr_reader :id, :text, :bookmark_id

  def initialize(id:, text:, bookmark_id:)
    @id = id
    @text = text
    @bookmark_id = bookmark_id
  end
end
```

Creating a comment is now refactored to use the `Comment` model. Let's look at refactoring viewing a comment.

First we can move finding the comments into the `Comment` model.

Let's update the test in `Bookmark.comments`:
```ruby
# in spec/bookmark_spec.rb
# ... tests omitted for brevity
let(:comment_class) { double(:comment_class) }

describe '#comments' do
  it 'calls .where on the Comment class' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(title: 'Makers Academy', url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
    expect(comment_class).to receive(:where).with(bookmark_id: bookmark.id)

    bookmark.comments(comment_class)
  end
end
```

And let's write the code in `Bookmark` to pass this test:
```ruby
# in lib/bookmark.rb

require_relative './comment.rb'

class Bookmark
  # rest of class

  def comments(comment_class = Comment)
    comment_class.where(bookmark_id: id)
  end
end
```

> You might notice we are using `where` for retrieving `Comment`s, but we used `find` to retrieve a single `Bookmark`. Why have we named these methods differently, even though they do similar things?

The feature test for viewing comments is now failing, because we need to update the `Comment` model with a `where` method. Again, start with a test:

```ruby
# in spec/comment_spec.rb
# tests omitted for brevity

describe '.where' do
  it 'gets the relevant comments from the databse' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(url: "http://www.makersacademy.com", title: "Makers Academy")
    Comment.create(text: 'This is a test comment', bookmark_id: bookmark.id)
    Comment.create(text: 'This is a second test comment', bookmark_id: bookmark.id)

    comments = Comment.where(bookmark_id: bookmark.id)
    comment = comments.first
    persisted_data = persisted_data(table: 'comments', id: comment.id)

    expect(comments.length).to eq 2
    expect(comment.id).to eq persisted_data.first['id']
    expect(comment.text).to eq 'This is a test comment'
    expect(comment.bookmark_id).to eq bookmark.id
  end
end
```

And update the `comment` model to pass this test:
```ruby
# in lib/comment.rb

class Comment
  # code omitted for brevity

  def self.where(bookmark_id:)
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM comments WHERE bookmark_id = #{bookmark_id};")
    result.map do |comment|
      Comment.new(
        id: comment['id'],
        text: comment['text'],
        bookmark_id: comment['bookmark_id']
      )
    end
  end
end
```

Completing the refactor by updating the `bookmarks` view to handle this new `Comment` model that will be returned by `bookmark.comments`:
```html
<!-- in views/bookmarks/index.erb -->
<!-- code omitted for brevity -->

<ul>
  <% bookmark.comments.each do |comment| %>
    <li><%= comment.text %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Comments have now been refactored to use the MVC design pattern.
