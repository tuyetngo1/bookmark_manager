# Walkthrough - Interacting with PostgreSQL from Ruby

[Back to Challenge](../07_interacting_with_postgres_from_ruby.md)

This walkthrough details how to get a Ruby program interacting with PostgreSQL. It's in three parts:

1. Installing `pg`, a Ruby gem that allows connection to and querying of PostgreSQL.
2. Use TDD to implement the use of `PG` to retrieve bookmarks from the database.
3. Understand the differences between the unit test and feature tests after this change.

If you prefer to follow this walkthrough by looking at a 'diff' – a visual difference between deleted and added code – check out [this commit](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/59c277884e54f520b0513cc3e0fcc2702d1e4ad2).

## 1. Installing `pg`

`pg` allows us to:

1. Connect to a PostgreSQL database
2. Execute SQL on that database, directly from Ruby

It's a gem, so we add it to our Gemfile:

```ruby
# Inside Gemfile

source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'pg'
gem 'sinatra'

gem 'capybara', group: :test
gem 'rspec', group: :test
```

And install it to the project with `bundle install`.

## Use TDD to implement `PG` and retrieve bookmarks from database

We already have a test for `Bookmark.all`:
```ruby
# Inside ./spec/bookmark_spec.rb

describe '.all' do
  it 'returns a list of bookmarks' do
    bookmarks = Bookmark.all

    expect(bookmarks).to include "http://makers.tech"
    expect(bookmarks).to include "http://www.destroyallsoftware.com"
    expect(bookmarks).to include "http://www.google.com"
  end
end
```

To test the `Bookmark` Model we'll interact with the database, to check that `.all` does actually retrieve data. This means that our tests for the `Model` are checking that it is correctly integrating with the database, and fetching the data we expect to be returned. Once the data is received we'll need to make sure the urls are returned as strings in an array.

We'll use the [`pg` documentation](https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/wiki/Home) to help us implement the code to get this test passing.

### Investigating PG

From reviewing the [`pg` documentation](https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/wiki/Home) we can see that:
- The `pg` gem makes a `PG` object available in Ruby.
- We can call `connect` on the `PG` object, passing in the database name.
- This will return an object that we can send a query to, let's call that object `connection`.
- To retrieve bookmarks from the database, we'll call `exec` on the `connection` object, passing in a query string.

The documentation isn't clear what this query will return, however it does show that we can iterate over it, so let's do some investigation using `irb`:

```irb
require 'pg'
 => true
connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
 => #<PG::Connection:0x007fc9c79700e8>
result = connection.exec('SELECT * FROM bookmarks')
 => #<PG::Result:0x007fc9c7958628 status=PGRES_TUPLES_OK ntuples=3 nfields=2 cmd_tuples=3>
2.4.1 :005 > result.each { |bookmark| p bookmark }
{"id"=>"1", "url"=>"http://makers.tech"}
{"id"=>"2", "url"=>"http://www.destroyallsoftware.com"}
{"id"=>"3", "url"=>"http://www.google.com"}
 => #<PG::Result:0x007fc9c7830cc8 status=PGRES_TUPLES_OK ntuples=3 nfields=2 cmd_tuples=3>
```

### Connecting to the database

Making sure your previous code in `Bookmark.all` has been removed, run the test. You should see an error:
```
1) Bookmark.all returns a list of bookmarks
   Failure/Error: expect(bookmarks).to include('http://www.makersacademy.com')
     expected nil to include "http://www.makersacademy.com", but it does not respond to `include?`
```

Not hugely helpful, but let's slowly implement the database connection, running our test after every step! First, let's use `PG` to connect to the database:
```ruby
# in lib/bookmark.rb

require 'pg'

class Bookmark
  def self.all
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
  end
end
```

Now running the test shows us that `Bookmark.all` returns a `PG::Connection` object:

```
1) Bookmark.all returns a list of bookmarks
   Failure/Error: expect(bookmarks).to include('http://www.makersacademy.com')

     expected #<PG::Connection:0x007fa9c93944d0> to include "http://www.makersacademy.com", but it does not respond to `include?`
     Diff:
     @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
     -["http://www.makersacademy.com"]
     +#<PG::Connection:0x007fa9c93944d0>

```

So we're ready to run the query on that connection:
```ruby
# in lib/bookmark.rb

require 'pg'

class Bookmark
  def self.all
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
    connection.exec("SELECT * FROM bookmarks;")
  end
end
```

Running the test shows us that this returns a `PG::Result`:
```
1) Bookmark.all returns a list of bookmarks
   Failure/Error: expect(bookmarks).to include('http://www.makersacademy.com')

     expected #<PG::Result:0x007fa311ec8720 status=PGRES_TUPLES_OK ntuples=3 nfields=3 cmd_tuples=3> to include "http://www.makersacademy.com"
     Diff:
     @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
     -["http://www.makersacademy.com"]
     +#<PG::Result:0x007fa311ec8720 status=PGRES_TUPLES_OK ntuples=3 nfields=3 cmd_tuples=3>
```

So let's assign that to a `result` variable and map over it to return the `url`s:

```ruby
class Bookmark
  def self.all
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
    result = connection.exec('SELECT * FROM bookmarks')
    result.map { |bookmark| bookmark['url'] }
  end
end
```

The tests should now all pass again.

So we now have passing feature tests that interact with Views, Controller and Model; passing integration tests that check that the `bookmark` model interacts with the database as expect; and we should be able to run our application and add bookmarks, live, to our application via `psql`.

> If your feature tests aren't passing – take a look in your database. Is the data in the database an exact match for the data your app expects?
