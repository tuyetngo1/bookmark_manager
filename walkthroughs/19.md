# Walkthrough – Authentication

[Back to Challenge](../19_authentication.md)

Authentication is split into **happy paths** and **unhappy paths**:

- On the **happy path**, users give the correct email and password.
- On one **unhappy path**, the user gives the incorrect email.
- On the other **unhappy path**, the user gives the incorrect password.

> Write happy paths before unhappy paths. Many unhappy paths can be implemented as edge case – maybe even guard clauses – on happy paths.

This walkthrough is in three parts:

1. The Happy Path (successful sign-in)
2. The Unhappy Paths (wrong email and wrong password)
3. Signing Out

There are git commits available for each. Where possible, try to use them instead of relying on these walkthroughs.

## 1. The Happy Path

> My implementation of the happy path is also available as a single [commit](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/4a68cb5d5b31514ec31c7a6672a33ea2db9db55f).

### 1. Feature-test successful sign-in

We need a feature test for the **happy path**: the ideal outcome. In our case, that's 'successful sign-in'.

```ruby
# in spec/features/authentication_spec.rb

feature 'authentication' do
  it 'a user can sign in' do
    # Create a test user
    User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    # Then sign in as them
    visit '/sessions/new'
    fill_in(:email, with: 'test@example.com')
    fill_in(:password, with: 'password123')
    click_button('Sign in')

    expect(page).to have_content 'Welcome, test@example.com'
  end
end
```

> I've chosen `session` to be the 'RESTful resource'. This is standard for 'signing in'.

### 2. Pass the feature test

We can pass this test with a new route, `GET /sessions/new`:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/sessions/new' do
  erb :"sessions/new"
end
```

We'll also need a new view, `views/sessions/new.erb`:

```html
<!-- in views/sessions/new.erb -->

<form action="/sessions" method="post">
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Sign in" />
</form>
```

And a route to handle the form submission:

```ruby
# in app.rb

post '/sessions' do
  result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '#{params[:email]}'")
  user = User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])

  session[:user_id] = user.id
  redirect('/bookmarks')
end
```

In this route, we are:

- `SELECT * FROM users` fetching all users
- `WHERE email = '#{ params[:email] }'` where the email matches the submitted email
- `User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])` wrapping the result in a program object
- `session[:user_id] = user.id` setting the session with the user ID
- `redirect('/bookmarks')` redirecting back to the root.

### 3. Refactor

Let's refactor this messy route into the User model. Specifically, let's refactor it into an `.authenticate` class method we could imagine using like this:

```ruby
post '/sessions' do
  user = User.authenticate(email: params[:email], password: params[:password])
  session[:user_id] = user.id
  redirect('/bookmarks')
end
```

Here's a test for the `User.authenticate` method's 'happy path': when a user gives us the right password.

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.authenticate' do
  it 'returns a user given a correct username and password, if one exists' do
    user = User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')
    authenticated_user = User.authenticate('test@example.com', 'password123')

    expect(authenticated_user.id).to eq user.id
  end
end
```

Here's the implementation for that, extracted directly from the controller:

```ruby
# in lib/user.rb

def self.authenticate(email:, password:)
  result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '#{email}'")
  User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'])
end
```

## 2. Unhappy paths

There are two **unhappy paths**:

1. No such user: the user gives an email address that doesn't match any records in the database.
2. Wrong password: the user gives a password that doesn't match a User with the given email address.

### 1. No Such User

> A commit for this step is [here](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/0c2300f3d0fa5dc4ba2e59ffe1b91aa21a2dc52f).

Let's write a feature test for the first unhappy path, where there's no such User:

```ruby
# in spec/features/authentication_spec.rb

feature 'authentication' do
  scenario 'a user sees an error if they get their email wrong' do
    User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    visit '/sessions/new'
    fill_in(:email, with: 'nottherightemail@me.com')
    fill_in(:password, with: 'password123')
    click_button('Sign in')

    expect(page).not_to have_content 'Welcome, test@example.com'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Please check your email or password.'
  end
end
```

Let's add a unit test that mimics this failure. We'd like `User.authenticate` to do the following:

- When it's the happy path, return the user.
- When it's the unhappy path, return `nil`.

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.authenticate' do
  it 'returns nil given an incorrect email address' do
    user = User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    expect(User.authenticate(email: 'nottherightemail@me.com', password: 'password123')).to be_nil
  end
end
```

Let's implement a guard clause in `User.authenticate`. If the result from the database query contains no users, then no user was found:

```diff
# in lib/user.rb

class User
  def self.authenticate(email:, password:)
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '#{email}'")
+    return unless result.any?

    User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])
  end
end
```

Let's upgrade our controller to handle this failed login, too:

```ruby
# in app.rb

post '/sessions' do
  user = User.authenticate(email: params[:email], password: params[:password])

  if user
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    redirect('/bookmarks')
  else
    flash[:notice] = 'Please check your email or password.'
    redirect('/sessions/new')
  end
end
```

And let's add the Flash to the `sessions/new.erb` view:

```diff
<!-- in views/sessions/new.erb -->

+ <h2>
+   <%= flash[:notice] %>
+ </h2>

<form action="/sessions" method="post">
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Sign in" />
</form>
```

Our test passes: users cannot sign in using incorrect emails.

### 2. Wrong Password

> A commit for this step is [here](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/edc0375fcb98e8fcf1aaea173c6fe38a07dbf242).

Let's write another feature test: this time, for having the wrong password:

```ruby
# in spec/features/authentication_spec.rb

feature 'authentication' do
  scenario 'a user sees an error if they get their password wrong' do
    User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    visit '/sessions/new'
    fill_in(:email, with: 'test@example.com')
    fill_in(:password, with: 'wrongpassword')
    click_button('Sign in')

    expect(page).not_to have_content 'Welcome, test@example.com'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Please check your email or password.'
  end
end
```

And a unit test for `User.authenticate`:

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.authenticate' do
  it 'returns nil given an incorrect password' do
    user = User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    expect(User.authenticate(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'wrongpassword')).to be_nil
  end
end
```

And let's pass that test, using `BCrypt::Password.new`:

```diff
# in lib/user.rb

def self.authenticate(email, password)
  result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '#{email}'")

  return unless result.any?
+  return unless BCrypt::Password.new(result[0]['password']) == password

  User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'])
end
```

Our tests pass: we have completed the sign in spec!

## 3. Sign out

> A commit for this step is [here](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/2ed4c78f798a32dfa10e9971717d354e856235ef).

Signing out is, in CRUD terms, **'destroying' a session resource**. With that in mind, let's implement a test that clicks a button to sign out on the bookmarks page:

```ruby
# in spec/features/authentication_spec.rb

feature 'authentication' do
  scenario 'a user can sign out' do
    # Create the user
    User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    # Sign in as that user
    visit '/sessions/new'
    fill_in(:email, with: 'test@example.com')
    fill_in(:password, with: 'password123')
    click_button('Sign in')

    # Sign out
    click_button('Sign out')

    expect(page).not_to have_content 'Welcome, test@example.com'
    expect(page).to have_content 'You have signed out.'
  end
end
```

We can implement this button, which destroys a session, similarly to how we implemented the button that destroys bookmarks:

```html
<!-- in views/bookmarks/index.erb -->

<form action="/sessions/destroy" method="post">
  <input type="submit" value="Sign out" />
</form>
```

> We don't need a specific session ID to destroy, as a single session is unique to a single client-server relationship.

Let's make this work with a simple route in `app.rb`:

```ruby
# in app.rb

post '/sessions/destroy' do
  session.clear
  flash[:notice] = 'You have signed out.'
  redirect('/bookmarks')
end
```

We've now implemented sign out!
