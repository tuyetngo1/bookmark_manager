## Creating User stories

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md#challenges)

The website will have the following **specification**:

* Show a list of bookmarks
* Add new bookmarks
* Delete bookmarks
* Update bookmarks
* Comment on bookmarks
* Tag bookmarks into categories
* Filter bookmarks by tag
* Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks

> A specification is a list of **requirements**.

We'll be using a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) cycle (i.e. **outside-in testing**: Capybara first).

Throughout this challenge we'll create User Stories based on the specification, and sketch a high-level domain model.

> There's no need to create all user stories at once. In fact, doing so can trap us in having to build an app a particular way. Let's just create user stories for the first feature. Once we've built it, we can decide the next one. Same with domain models: don't draw the whole thing. Just jot down enough info to get started. Aim to get coding ASAP.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Generate User Stories from Requirements

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Write a user story for showing a list of bookmarks
- [ ] Draw a rough domain model for the above
- [ ] Put the user story and a snap of your domain model in your project README
