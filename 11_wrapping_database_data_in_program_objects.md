## Wrapping Database data in Program Objects

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md#challenges)

We've built a database-enabled MVC Sinatra application with test and development environments.

At the moment, when we use `Bookmark.all` to get bookmarks from the database, we just return an array of strings.

In this challenge, you will add a `title` column to the `bookmarks` table, and display it on the homepage instead of the link URL. To do this, you will need to **wrap database data in a Ruby object**.

## Learning Objectives

* Map objects across systems.

## Challenge Setup

A normal connection between a database and an application mode works in this way:

- Bring database data from database rows into your Ruby application.
- Wrap that data in Ruby objects (models).
- Ask a model to do things with the data it wraps.

> 'Do things' could include: just expose the data directly (for instance, a `Bookmark` just exposes its `url`), or use it in some way (for instance, an `Exam` might have an `average` method which does some calculation with scores stored as columns in the database).

For instance, let's imagine we're building a blog, which is a list of posts. The database for the blog has the following `posts` table:

```
| id | title                         |
|----|-------------------------------|
| 1  | The team is the thing         |
| 2  | Shovels make me sad           |
| 3  | What is the 'simplest thing'? |
```

Wrapping each row in a Ruby object allows me to access each post in my application as an instance of the `Post` class. Then, I can query each post: for instance, I could ask for `post.id`, `post.title`, or more complicated things like `post.word_count`.

The `Post` class would, in this case, _wrap_ the data in each row of the table, and provide a thin layer of logic on top of that data (for instance, logic for calculating the `word_count`).

> This pattern of accessing data from a database and wrapping it is sometimes called the 'Object-Relational Map (ORM) Pattern'.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Update the **test** and **development** databases so that bookmarks have a `title`, in addition to the `url`.
- [ ] Update creating a new bookmark so that a user enters a `url` and a `title`.
- [ ] Update the `/bookmarks` view to show Bookmark titles instead of Bookmark URLs.
  - [ ] Clicking a link in the list should open the `url` of the bookmark.

## Hints

#### Adding new fields to the database

Before you can save bookmarks with a title, or display the title in the `bookmarks`, you'll need to update the `bookmarks` table in the `development` and `test` databases. See the suggested resources before for more information on how to do this.

#### Returning objects that respond to `#id`, `#title` and `#url` from database queries

You may want to update the `Bookmark.all` method to return instances of the `Bookmark` class instead of strings. The instance should wrap and expose the attributes `id`, `title` and `url`.
